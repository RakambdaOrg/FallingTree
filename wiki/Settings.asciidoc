== Intro

Here I'll try to explain in a bit more details what are the different settings you'll find in FallingTree and when possible give some examples, so it's clearer.

There's 4 main sections that you'll find in the configuration file or in the config GUI:

* link:Settings---General[General]
* link:Settings---Trees[Trees]
* link:Settings---Tools[Tools]
* link:Settings---Player[Player]

Examples of full config files can be found link:Settings---Examples[here].

== Server

You have several options :

* Edit the config file in the config directory.
* Edit the configuration through the GUI on a client and upload the updated configuration file to the server.

== GUI

WARNING: This method is only supported in both Fabric and Forge in 1.16.4+ releases.

The config GUI offers you an easier way to edit the configuration.
Instead of going into the configuration files and edit them manually, just navigate through an in-game menu.

This GUI isn't activated by default and need a dependency for that.

=== Forge

You'll need to install the dependency https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge[Cloth Config API (Forge)].
When it is installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go into `Main menu > Mods > FallingTree > Config`.

=== Fabric

You'll need 2 dependencies :

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu[Mod Menu].
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config[Cloth Config API (Fabric)].

When they are installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go inside `Mods > FallingTree > Config`.
